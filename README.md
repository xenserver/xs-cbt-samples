# XenServer CBT sample code
This repository contains a collection of scripts that use the XenServer changed block tracking API. 

These scripts are an example of how to use the changed block tracking feature from end-to-end including:
* enabling changed block tracking
* copying changed blocks
* destroying unnecessary snapshot data.
* coalescing incremental backup onto base VDI 
* importing backup VDI

The examples are written in Python.

# How to use these scripts
